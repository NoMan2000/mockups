# Mockups

The purpose of these mockups is to build a responsive template for future cellcontrol designs.  The web fonts, icon fonts, typography used, color swatches, images, etc. are all pushed up with a somewhat default template in Balsamiq and Photoshop.  

The template is not pixel-perfect (or even remotely close to it), the goal is to be able to quickly transfer all the necessary files without having to manually download, install, go through the branding guidebook and pull out fonts and color schemes, create Photoshop layers, etc.
